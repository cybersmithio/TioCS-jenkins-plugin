    Instead of uploading the image to the cloud for inspection, the on-premise inspector can be used to pull out
    the metadata about the image, and instead just send that metadata to the cloud for reporting. WARNING:
    Tenable.io repositories are either cloud or on-prem, you cannot switch between them.
