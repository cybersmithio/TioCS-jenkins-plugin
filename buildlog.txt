* Everything compiled fine.  The field name OnPremInspector is now displaying.
* Have to figure out a way to put in headers for the form.
* Information like the image name is still not saving between form reloads.

* The form is now able to show field names with spaces, now that the config.properties file was added.
* Still need to get the data to save.

* Help messages are now displaying on the form when the help button is clicked for each field.
* Still need to get the data to save.

* The On-premise checkbox is now saving.  Not able to have the imagename yet.
* Realized that the form validation is allowing for a blank name, which shouldn't be

* Switching everything from imagename back to name allowed for things to be saved.  I wonder if this has something to
   do with things being left over in the work or target directories.
* Next, let's add another value to save, just as the Tenable.io repo to save the results in.

* Added new field TioRepo (tiorepo) but it is not serializing


August 24, 2019 12:23pm
* Got the compilation error: ""/home/jsmith/TioCS-plugin/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/TioCS/TioCSBuilder.java:[51,13] cannot assign a value to final variable tiorepo"
   which indicates the "final" keyword should not be used in the class definition for tiorepo.

* Form validation for repo name is working, although it is displayed above the field name and overlapping with the image name validation message.
* Tried a build to see what is displayed in the output, and we're getting the image name and on-prem values being put into output.

August 24, 2019 12:38pm
* So the tiorepo value seem to be stored, because it appeared in the build logs.  Now we just need to figure out why it isn't loaded into the
   form again if we go to edit it.  This is likely the same problem with the imagename variable.  Realized the useOnPrem variable
   is only ever used in the same case, and that is not the same as the tiorepo. Going to change that and see if that fixes it.

August 24, 2019 12:50pm
* The case change (making all cases uniform) worked, and now the repo is saving and restoring in the Configure section.
* Next to change the plugin section of the build output.

* The build log now has a section for Tenable.io CS that will display information about the build settings for TioCS in a nice format!!!
