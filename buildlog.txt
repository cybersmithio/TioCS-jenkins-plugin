* Everything compiled fine.  The field name OnPremInspector is now displaying.
* Have to figure out a way to put in headers for the form.
* Information like the image name is still not saving between form reloads.


August 24, 2019 10:54am
* The form is now able to show field names with spaces, now that the config.properties file was added.
* Still need to get the data to save.

August 24, 2019 11:01am
* Help messages are now displaying on the form when the help button is clicked for each field.
* Still need to get the data to save.

August 24, 2019 11:20am
* The On-premise checkbox is now saving.  Not able to have the imagename yet.
* Realized that the form validation is allowing for a blank name, which shouldn't be

August 24, 2019 12:07pm
* Switching everything from imagename back to name allowed for things to be saved.  I wonder if this has something to
   do with things being left over in the work or target directories.
* Next, let's add another value to save, just as the Tenable.io repo to save the results in.


August 24, 2019 12:18pm
* Added new field TioRepo (tiorepo) but it is not serializing


August 24, 2019 12:23pm
* Got the compilation error: ""/home/jsmith/TioCS-plugin/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/TioCS/TioCSBuilder.java:[51,13] cannot assign a value to final variable tiorepo"
   which indicates the "final" keyword should not be used in the class definition for tiorepo.

* Form validation for repo name is working, although it is displayed above the field name and overlapping with the image name validation message.
* Tried a build to see what is displayed in the output, and we're getting the image name and on-prem values being put into output.

August 24, 2019 12:38pm
* So the tiorepo value seem to be stored, because it appeared in the build logs.  Now we just need to figure out why it isn't loaded into the
   form again if we go to edit it.  This is likely the same problem with the imagename variable.  Realized the useOnPrem variable
   is only ever used in the same case, and that is not the same as the tiorepo. Going to change that and see if that fixes it.

August 24, 2019 12:50pm
* The case change (making all cases uniform) worked, and now the repo is saving and restoring in the Configure section.
* Next to change the plugin section of the build output.

August 24, 2019 1:01pm
* The build log now has a section for Tenable.io CS that will display information about the build settings for TioCS in a nice format!!!

August 24, 2019 3:29pm
* Successfully compiled with function to call external program.  Just testing for now, using the ls command.  Will use docker commands in future.

August 24, 2019 3:49pm
*** Plugin is now able to upload an image to Tenable.io CS.  Next steps are to get the report downloaded.  May use something other than CSUP so we don't need
      another external program.

August 24, 2019 4:07pm
* Compiled test code to get report from Tenable.io.  It makes the request but of course gets a 401 unauthorized for now.

August 24, 2019 4:25pm
* Image report is downloading successfully now.  Need to parse the JSON.

August 24, 2019 5:03pm
* Figured out how to import the JSON library through Maven central.  Now to get it parsing stuff.

August 25, 2019 12:37am
* Cloud testing and reporting is working.
* On-prem inspection and reporting in the cloud is working.
* MVP reached, but need to do more:
* Get the Tenable.io credential fields being populated from Jenkins credentials.
* Add a tag field for the images being tested and the reports being stored in IO
* Add a flag to fail if malware is discovered.

August 25, 2019 9:39am
* Additional information added into plugin output.

August 25, 2019 9:41am
* Sensitive data now converted to password fields to data is not visible.

August 25, 2019 11:36am
* Added failure for malware, and the results are being reported into the Tenable.io Action in Jenkins.

August 26, 2019
* Added an image size field.

August 26, 2019 11:30pm
* Took me 5 hours, but finally figured out the right syntax and directory to get the Tenable icon to appear for the Action men.
